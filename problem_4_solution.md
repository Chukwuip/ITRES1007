# Problem 4:
You have been approached by a Social Sciences researcher who wishes to collect some data from Twitter and Facebook to follow the comments posted by a particular group of individuals in the run-up 
to the 2019 Indian general election.
How would you go about the process of Requirements Analysis for this query? What are the most important questions you should ask, and why?

# Solution

Requirements analysis is a crucial step in any data collection project, as it helps ensure that the data collected aligns with the goals and objectives of the research. In the context of collecting data from Twitter and Facebook for studying comments related to the 2019 Indian general election, here are some important questions to ask during the requirements analysis:
I will be asking some series of questions under the following sub headings.

**1. Research Objectives:**

What are the specific research objectives and goals of collecting data from Twitter and Facebook?
What insights or knowledge does the researcher hope to gain from the collected data?
Why: Understanding the overall purpose of the research helps in shaping the specific data collection requirements and methodologies.

**2. Target Audience:**

Who is the target audience or group of individuals whose comments are being studied?
What criteria define the inclusion or exclusion of individuals in the study?
Why: Defining the target audience helps in narrowing down the scope of data collection and ensuring relevance to the research goals.

**3. Data Sources:**

What keywords, hashtags, or terms will be used to identify relevant posts and comments?
Are there specific accounts, groups, or pages that should be included or excluded?
Why: Identifying relevant data sources is crucial for obtaining a dataset that is representative of the study's focus.

**4. Research Scope:**

What is the time frame for data collection? (e.g., specific dates leading up to the election)
Are there any specific events or milestones during this period that should be considered?
Why: Defining the temporal scope helps in capturing data during the critical phases of the election campaign.

**5. Ethical Considerations:**

What ethical considerations need to be addressed in collecting data from social media platforms?
How will the researcher handle issues related to privacy and consent?
Why: Ensuring ethical data collection practices is essential for maintaining the integrity of the research and complying with platform policies.

**6. Data Types:**

What types of data are required? (e.g., text, images, links)
Are there specific sentiments or emotions the researcher is interested in?
Why: Understanding the desired data types helps in selecting appropriate methods for data extraction and analysis.

**7. Platform-Specific Considerations:**

What platform-specific limitations and features need to be considered? (e.g., Twitter API rate limits)
Are there any specific platform policies that impact data collection?
Why: Adhering to platform-specific considerations is crucial for successful and compliant data collection.

**8. Analysis and Reporting:**

How will the collected data be analyzed and reported?
Are there any specific visualizations or reports the researcher envisions?
Why: Planning for data analysis and reporting ensures that the collected data serves the intended purpose and provides meaningful insights.

By addressing these questions during the requirements analysis phase, the researcher can develop a comprehensive plan for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from Twitter and Facebook in a manner that aligns with the research objectives and ethical standards.
